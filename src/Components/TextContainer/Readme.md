### Size

Set a size to apply to all child text elements without explicitly set sizes

```js
<TextContainer size="4">
  <Heading element="2" size="3">Heading with its own size</Heading>
  <p>This text inherits its size from the parent.</p>
  <TextContainer size="6">
    <p>This text inherits its size from its own parent.</p>
  </TextContainer>
</TextContainer>
```

### Tight Spacing

Use tight spacing to relate content elements to each other.

```js
<TextContainer tight>
  <Heading element="3">Game of Thrones</Heading>
  <p>Season 1, Episodes 1-10</p>
</TextContainer>
```
