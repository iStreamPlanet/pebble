A design token is a reusable design decision expressed as a property-value pair. Design Tokens are threaded throughout iStreamPlanet components to maintain a consistent visual style.

They are available for use by teams for creating custom components or UI to maintain consistency across applications.

## CSS Reset

Pebble uses a targeted set of css rules that normalizes styles.

The `<html>` and `<body>` elements are updated to provide better page-wide defaults. More specifically:

* The margin in all browsers is removed.
* The default Pebble design background color is applied.

See the full set of styles on [CSS Reset](/#/Styles/CSS%20Reset).
