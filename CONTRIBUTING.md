## Become a Contributor

Here's how you can contribute to Pebble:

1. Report bugs or propose new features by [filing a Github issue](https://github.com/iStreamPlanet/pebble/issues).
1. Code something and make a pull request.
1. Design a new component or update the styles.
1. Submit updates to the documentation.

## How to Contribute

We welcome and encourage contributions. Contribute feature ideas, fixes, updates of all sizes.

Before you start to code, we recommend [filing an issue](https://github.com/iStreamPlanet/pebble/issues) to discuss your idea. This gives us the opportunity to offer feedback or additional considerations before you begin the work of coding.

We review issues and pull requests on a weekly basis. When we require more information from you, we’ll ask. In order to keep the issue and pull request queue clean, we ask that you respond within **one week** or we’ll close the issue pending your response.

## Submitting Pull Requests

We welcome and encourage contributions. We will make our best effort to process pull requests with constructive feedback.

To make a pull request you will need a GitHub account. See GitHub’s documentation on [forking] and [pull requests].

After an issue is created or a pull request is submitted, contributors and/or maintainers will offer feedback. If the pull request passes review, a maintainer will accept it with a comment.

When a pull request is submitted, lint, unit tests, and visual regression testing will automatically run on the pr.

When a pull request for code contribution fails unit testing, the author is expected to update the pull request to address the failure(s) until it passes testing and the pull request can merge cleanly.

Pebble uses [Chromatic](https://www.chromaticqa.com) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for visual regression testing. Each push to the build service will run the Chromatic service. If there are visual changes detected in any component story, a maintainer will be required to review and approve/deny the difference in the [Chromatic App](https://www.chromaticqa.com/builds?appId=5c893af34635b40020991b72).

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches.

Components have the following folder structure:

```shell
src
└─Components
  └─ComponentName
      ComponentName.js
      ComponentName.scss
      ComponentName.test.js
      Readme.md
      stories.js
```

- The Readme.js file used by style-guidist to auto-generate the docs page. Please be sure to provide common cases of the component in use.
- Unit tests are automatically run on each pull request. The build will fail if any tests fail. To manually run tests, run `yarn cover`.
- For code syntax and style, we use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) with [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Contributing to the Documentation

Pebble currently uses [react-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) for most of its documentation. Each component folder has a `Readme.md` file that contains the documentation for that component. These files are used to generate [pebble.istreamplanet.net](https://pebble.istreamplanet.net).

If you find an error or have a question about the documentation, please [file an issue](https://github.com/iStreamPlanet/pebble/issues).
